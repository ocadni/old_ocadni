My research interests follow several lines. One is related to the so-called Science of City. The accumulation of huge amount of data in the last years allows, nowedays, new quantitative studies on one of the most complex system: the urban system.
Another line of research is on the cross-field interaction between statistical physics of complex systems, inference problems and neural networks. Another line  is about visualization and presentation of scientific results: why one has to write a “manuscript” (format invented in late 16th century) to publish scientific results on {{ site.time | date: '%-d %B %Y' }}?

### Science of City.
In the last years, I tried to quantify the efficiency and quality of public transports in urban systems. The results are shown on <a href="www.citychrone.org" target="_blanck">CityChrone</a> platform. Recently i'm interested in modelling urban displacements in city.

### Statistical physics, optimizations problems.
I worked for my bachelor and master thesis on statistical mechanics of disorder systems. During my Ph.D I focused my attention on the strong similarity and possible cross-field interaction between statistical physics and optimizations problems in computer science. In particular on belief propagation and linear programming algorithms applied to NP-Hard problems.

### Epidemic inference problems.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear that epidemic inference problems based on individual-level contact data, such as the one of identifying infective but asymptomatic individuals, are central in order to devise more effective prevention and containment strategies. I'm interested in inference algorithms that are able to solve large class of inference problem in epidemics, ranging from the patient zero to the risk assessment problem.


### Quantum physics, probability distribution approximation.
I explored the possible applications of the belief propagation algorithms to characterize quantum spin systems. Moreover in last years new connections have been made between neural networks and quantum wave functions. The union of this two field could lead to new discoveries that can potentially change both fields of research.

### Scientific and data visualizations.
I'm involved in finding new and more modern way to understand, share and disseminate the results of scientific research. The scientific works gain their real value only when they are, in some way, absorbed by the society. In this regard applications, website and data visualizations tools that allow people from different domains to appreciate the scientific results achieved are fundamental. Moreover this allow to engage people to solve scientific problems, using the power of the so-called "collective intelligence". I developed the <a href="www.citychrone.org" target="_blank">CityChrone</a> Platform also with this in mind. On the platform it is possible to construct new public transport scenario and see how its impact the quality of public transport. The goal is to use the intelligence of the citizen to solve a very complicate optimization problem, otherwise intractable by brute-force optimization algorithms. The CityChrone platform is designed to work also on a touch-table, allowing collective session [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sm8VOwJSA&t=7s" target="_blank">video</a>].
