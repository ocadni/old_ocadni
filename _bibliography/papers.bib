  abstract  = {Urban systems studies in the last decades have greatly benefited from the digital revolution and the accumulation of a massive amount of data. Extracting useful information from these data calls for new and innovative theoretical and computational approaches. This work presents an open-source, modular, and scalable platform for urban planning and transports network analysis, the CityChrone [citychrone.org]. The platform shows, on interactive maps, measures of performances of public transport in cities. The measures are based on the computation of the travel time distance between a large set of points. Thanks to the high efficiency of the routing algorithm developed, the platform allows users to create new public transports networks and showing the effect on mobility in a small amount of time. A preliminary analysis of the user-generated scenarios is presented. All the source code of the CityChrone platform is open-source, and we employ only open data to ensure the reproducibility of results.},
